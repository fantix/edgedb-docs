EdgeDB is an object-relational database that stores and describes the data
as strongly typed objects and relationships between them.

EdgeDB features:

- strict, strongly typed schema;
- powerful and clean query language;
- ability to easily work with complex hierarchical data;
- built-in support for schema migrations.

EdgeDB is not a graph database: the data is stored and queried using
relational database techniques.  Unlike most graph databases, EdgeDB
maintains a strict schema.

EdgeDB is not a document database, but inserting and querying hierarchical
document-like data is trivial.

EdgeDB is not a traditional object database, despite the classification,
it is not an implementation of OOP persistence.
